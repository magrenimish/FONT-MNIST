# TMNIST-TYPEFACE-MNIST </br>
This repository contains the TMNIST data files. This dataset is inspired by the MNIST database for handwritten digits. </br> 
It consists of images representing digits from 0-9 produced using 2,990 google fonts files. </br>
Following is a description of the files:</br>
1. Each of the numpy array files (.npy) provide an array representation of the typeface names, the image labels (0-9) and the grayscale images.
2. The 'images.zip' file contains the 29,900 (28x28) grayscale images
3. The 'TMNIST_data.zip' file contains a csv file with 29,901 rows and 786 columns: Each row contains 786 elements: the first element represents 
the font name (ex-Chivo-Italic, Sen-Bold), the second element represents the label (a number from 0-9) and the remaining 784 elements represent 
the grayscale pixel values (from 0-255) for the 28x28 pixel image. </br>
